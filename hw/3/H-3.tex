\nextprob{Four Colors Suffice}
% ============================================
% ============================================
Read Chapters $2$ and $3$ of \emph{Four Colors Suffice} and answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Who are the Austrian(s) mentioned in Chapters $1$--$3$, and what was their
        contribution mentioned in the book?

        \paragraph{Answer}

    \item Write a statement of the four color theorem using a universal
        quantifier.

    \item What is the definition of a $k$-coloring of a graph?

        \paragraph{Answer}
        \todo{your answer here.}

    \item Prove or disprove: all plane graphs (maps) are three-colorable.

        \paragraph{Answer}
        \todo{}

    \item Assuming the four color theorem holds, prove or disprove: six colors
        suffice to color a plane graph.

        \paragraph{Answer}
        \todo{}

    \item Give an example of a map with at least five faces that has a
        two-coloring.  Be sure to provide a coloring as evidence that the map is
        two-colorable.

        \paragraph{Answer}
        \todo{your answer here.}

    \item Euler's formula states that if we have a map on the sphere or plane
        and count the exterior face as a face, then F-E+V=2.  Does this equation
        hold if the map is drawn on a M\"obius band? Why or why not? (Note:
        here, the boundary of the M\"obius band must be represented in the graph
        defining the map, and no ``country'' can be on the same side of a single
        edge.)

        \todo{your answer here.}

    \item In your own words, explain the joke: ``A topologist cannot tell the
        difference between a coffee cup and a donut.''  You are encouraged to
        use Wikipedia to formulate your answer, but be sure to cite sources.
